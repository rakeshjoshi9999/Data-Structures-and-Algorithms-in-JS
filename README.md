## 📌 Patterns Covered

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔹 Sliding Window | Fixed/Variable window problems |
| 🔹 Two Pointers | Opposite or same direction pointer movement |
| 🔹 Fast & Slow Pointers | Cycle detection, linked list middle |
| 🔹 Merge Intervals | Interval scheduling problems |
| 🔹 Binary Search | Search problems, optimization |
| 🔹 BFS / DFS | Graph and tree traversal |
| 🔹 Dynamic Programming | Subproblems & memoization |
| 🔹 Backtracking | Recursion with constraints |
| 🔹 Greedy | Locally optimal → globally optimal |
| 🔹 Bit Manipulation | XOR tricks, masks |
